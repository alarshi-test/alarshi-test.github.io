About me
======

I am currently a post-doctoral scholar at the Geological Sciences, University of Florida under  <a href="https://jdannberg.github.io/">Dr. Juliane Dannberg </a>. 
My research focuses on setting up present-day global mantle numerical models based on physical parameters
inferred from seismic tomography, faults database, and plate motion.
I am using <a href="https://geodynamics.org/cig/software/aspect/"> ASPECT </a> to setup and run all my
models.

<!-- Software
------
I am one of the principal developers and maintainers of the free modeling software [ASPECT](https://aspect.geodynamics.org) (Advanced Solver for
Problems in Earth's Convection). ASPECT uses modern numerical methods to support research in simulating convection in the Earth's mantle and elsewhere. -->
